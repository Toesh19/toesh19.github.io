			<p> Though I was born in NZ my parents are from India. Same as my grandparents and even my great-grantparents. I was born in 2008 in Auckland and I have many hobbies such as football and gaming. I also have many interests in school such as math and science which I enjoy doing. I currently go to Botany Downs Secondary College although I have been to other schools as well such as Mission Heights and Willowbank. Some random facts about myself is that my favourite colour is black and my favourite show is Avatar: The last airbender. I am also very hardworking and committed in everything I do which I think is are a few of my best traits. </p>
